I was really comfortable with his guidance through the menu and his service. The food is really good and I like the level of spices. It's not my first time and it won't be the last for sure. Two thumps up for the great service team. They are the key for the success."

Not happy with the quantity as well for the price they charge.  Biryani is okay, and in mix girll platter more or less everything tastes the same.  They need to maintain proper air conditioning as sometimes the place gets really hot during peak summer and poor lit cabins in family section, dark ambience. place is good for only one time visit."

I will not pay again for a dish and a drink 10 times a regular dish in Riyadh. Is crazy. Not to mention that if you go alone..the chances of interacting with others is zero due to... you know. So. Is not worthy."

The attention was fast and precise, the food superb.  Then the waiter brought us wet napkins, no body asked us for coffee or dessert and equally fast we received the check without asking for it!!! We commented this facts and I felt we were swept out the place!!! I even made the comment that groups that arrived before and a couple of ladies that arrived simultaneously were still enjoying at their table while we were walking out the place. Is this how you make the place productive? Are we expats uncomfortable to you? (We were westerners appropriately dressed for the occasion). "
